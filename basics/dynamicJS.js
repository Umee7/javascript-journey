// Js is dynamic typing language in which the datatype will be autoassigned to variable on the go in runtime.

let box = "string"; //lets say in this it saw a box getting added string so now it decides it is a  string box

box = 10; // oops now it is a number box

// in static typed languagues like c++
// string cakeBox; tell whats it before
// cakeBox = "pineapple Cake"; can only add strings
// cakeBox = 10; You cant change now buddy, too late
